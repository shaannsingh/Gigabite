# Gigabite
Gigabite shares its favourite recipes with whatever you give it, 2 ingredients or 20, it will turn quantity into quality!

- This is my first unsupervised, fully independent coding project, coming from about 1-2 years of learning from the ground up. I just want to build for art's sake, trying and failing has more value to me than waiting for some 10x engineer with a Stanford MBA to accept my LinkedIn coffee chat.

- 1/8/23: I've successfully made a home page for gigabite with a little help from Anthropic's Claude to help me with bugs. I'm gonna make a dashboard of what I should start with, maybe finish up some more UI.

- 3/8/23: Worked on some cool buttons. I've started data collection for my Llama 3.1 model, I'm still figuring out how to run collection scripts, never ran those before.
